# Churn-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning
Project Aim : 
Predictive model for a bank to predict it's customers churn for product ‘Savings Account’ using Machine Learning!


This file include the solution for churn prediction using ML , The data set also included in .csv file


What is Churn !
Churn is defined as movement of one customer from a company into another. If we can predict churn before some time, the company can execute some preventive measures, so that loss can be adjusted. Here in this project I’m building a predictive model for a bank to predict its customers churn for product ‘Savings Account’ using Machine Learning


What is Machine Learning : 
Field of study that gives computers the capability to learn without being explicitly programmed
